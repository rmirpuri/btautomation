Areas of improvement
When user enters email in incorrect format and clicks on Submit, we get a message "Error occurred, check the network tab on your browser's developer tools for more details". User should get a correct message

User cannot submit form without entering Tags. Noticed that we either need to mark Tags dropdown with astreick or allow user to submit form without selecting Tags field.
Tags field should be a radio button instead of checkbox. 

Contact email field should be mandatory. User should not be allowed to submit form without providing email address. 

There should be a limit to how many characters that can be entered in the Title. If users exceeds the limit there should be an error message below the field.

On the homepage, there should be headers to the columns 

On the homepage, when user submits form as "Dashboard" it appears as NA on homepage after submitting.

Email should be sent to the user with request id

We should bave a way for the user to check the status of their request after they submit the form.

Entering long title misaligns the columns after submitting the form on homepage

On the homepage the time of the submission should be of local time of the user and not in UTC

When user clicks on the Edit button on homepage, Application area should display the value previously submitted by the user

User should not be allowed to delete the request. They should be only allowed to cancel the request.

If Delete feature is necessary then there should be a warning message to user after they click on the Delete button. 

There should not be Resolved check box on the form. This shoule be enabled after the user has submitted the form.

Any ticket that is marked as Resolved should not be allowed to Edit. Instead Edit should change into "Reopen"
